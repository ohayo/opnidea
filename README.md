# opnidea
 Opnidea (Code name: envision) was an experimental social media platform of open ideas and motivational user generated content similar to WeHeartIt and Pinterest, I made it due to the aforementioned not listening to their users, I was unable to continue hosting it as money got tight and development was slowed due to me beginning university. It used to be hosted on opnidea.com
